        "description": "## Background\n\nThe VA Facilities API version 1 (v1) provides information about VA facilities, including locations, addresses, phone numbers, hours of operation, and available services.\n\nVA operates several different types of facilities. This API gives information about:\n- Health facilities (vha)\n- Benefits facilities (vba)\n- Cemeteries (nca)\n- Vet Centers (vc)\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nFor in-depth details on data sources for the Facilities API, [read our Facilities GitHub documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-facilities#readme).\n\nHealth service data for v1 of this API is based on both real-time and historical data.\n\n- Historical data is returned for the previous 30 days. Data is based on both pending and completed appointments for a given facility.\n- Service-related data may be added, removed, or modified by an authorized individual at the data facility. These data changes are available to v1 of this API in real time.\n\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\n\nVA Facilities is an open data API. Open data API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token that's provided in an HTTP header with the name 'apikey'.\n\n### Test data\n\nTest data for the sandbox environment is only for testing the API and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. After testing this API in sandbox, you can start the process of moving to production.\n\n### Facility ID formats\n\nA facility ID has the format prefix_stationNumber. The prefix is nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be VA national cemeteries or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an s. There are no other constraints on the format. Some facility ID examples are:\n- Health: `vha_402GA`\n- Benefits: `vba_539GB`\n- National cemetery: `nca_063`\n- Non-national cemetery: `nca_s1082`\n- Vet Center: `vc_0872MVC`\n\n\n### Mobile Facilities\n\nThe mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with \"mobile\": \"true\", the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the mobile facility number listed."
